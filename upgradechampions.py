#Upgrade in campain

#simple implementation - only 1*
#upgrade only lvl 1 champions by running 3 times in 12-3
#better option: run 2 times in 12-3 brutal and 1 time in 12-3 hard. (2 less energy)

#simple
#select 3 champions at the end of the champ row - run 3 times

#advanced - need to use alpha channel
#select 3 champions lvl 1 (same star rating)
#if 1* run 3 times
#if 2* run 10 times

#results with threshhold 0.95 
# It did much all common champions(grey frame). It did match both 1 star and 2 stars.
# It did not match any uncommon(green frame)

#results with threshhold 0.97
# did match some 2star level 1 uncommon champions, also 3 star uncommon lvl1

#Simple solution:
# take picture of every common and uncommon level 1 champ. Search these and upgrade.
# take picture of the part with level 1. Don't take into picture # of stars.
