    # V3. boss tile with   - a bigger pentagonal frame with 3 rewards
    # V4. chest tile       - regular hexagon frame
    # V5. Phrygius boss    - special (icy) frame

    # some frames have scull attached at bottom
    # boss tiles V3 - can be with or without scull. The one with scull means boss has blessing


    # IF tile can be accessed - frame is always has light, thick rim

    # how to spot these?
    # they have a frame - 

    # when V1 is defeated, view is centered to this tile
